---

This report details the project work titled **"Refactoring and Publishing EduAid"** undertaken during **Google Summer of Code 2024** under the mentorship of **AOSSIE**. My name is Krishna Madhwani, and as a Computer Science and Engineering student at IIT BHU, I was fortunate to have this incredible opportunity to contribute to **EduAid** during GSoC'24. During my time in GSoC 2024, I focused on significantly advancing the EduAid Chrome extension by incorporating new features and refining its existing functionalities. My primary goal was to enhance the platform‚Äôs versatility and usability for both educators and students.

- **Status:** Merged
- **Description:** Upgraded the question generator to support a wider variety of question types, including Multiple Choice, Single Correct, and Boolean Questions.

  **Implementation Details:**

  - **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs):**
    - **Model Choice:** Used the T5 model, known for its text-to-text transfer capabilities, to generate concise and relevant questions from given content.
    - **Distractors Generation:** Utilized NLP libraries such as `nltk` and `gensim` for synonym generation and semantic similarity. Techniques like word embeddings and contextual analysis were applied to ensure distractors were plausible and challenging.
    - **Contextual Fit:** Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure that generated options were contextually relevant and grammatically correct.
  
  - **One Word Questions:**
    - **Keyword Extraction:** Employed T5 and Multipartite Rank for extracting significant keywords from text. 
    - **Question Generation:** Used these keywords to form questions by analyzing the context and syntactical structure of sentences.
  
  - **Boolean Questions:**
    - **Statement Simplification:** Used T5 for summarizing statements into true/false propositions. 
    - **False Statement Generation:** Generated false statements by altering the sentence structure or using paraphrasing techniques to ensure the statements were grammatically correct and logically sound.
    - **Evaluation:** Used BERT embeddings to evaluate the semantic similarity between true and generated false statements.
